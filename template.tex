\section{Introduction}
From interactive sculptures to light projections, the interactive art scene has enthralled audiences throughout the world \cite{sarto_disneys_2021, noauthor_teamlab_2020}.  By creating digital projections, responsive animations, and live video feeds, artists have blurred the lines between traditional art and technology.  Many of these installations incorporate visuals and audio and ask participants to interact with physical pieces of the exhibit. This interaction is usually tactile, verbal, or a motion on the part of the audience that causes a change in the art piece itself.  Through their interactive nature, these exhibits allow users to experience art in a 4D space since the exhibit changes with interactions over time. 

Interactive installations are nothing new. Since the 1960s, interactive art exhibits have ethralled artsts and computer scientists alike\cite{trifonova_software_2008}.  While these intial installations were not computationally intensive, they still captiured the imaginations and curiousities of users young and old.  People wanted to push the limits and see what was possible with these interactive installations, something that forces the creators of these installations to brainstorm every eventuality and/or possibility.  Because users are unpredictable, it is important to place constraints on the possible actions that a user can take and to provide cues to the user when something is not possible within the program.  When designed correctly, these cues remind the user of the intention of the project while also nudging in the right direction for the next step in their user journey.  

``Computational Queries'' seeks to explore the innate curiousity within each person. The installation will allow users the flexibility to explore and discover new features and levels while also giving the users a sense of accomplishment when they discover something new even if it was not the intended user path. 

\section{Problem Context}	
The focus of this paper surrounds an interactive art piece entitled ``Computational Queries'' that seeks to explore curiousity and discoverability.  The childlike wonder and curiosity that comes with discovering something new and interesting is unparalleled. This exhibit aims to provide an avenue for exploration and accomplishment through play.  ``Computational Queries'' is an interactive art installation that incorporates user movement and responsive projections to create a geometric pattern that shifts and changes according to the position of a user's hands.  Users will wave their hands around in front of the camera and the geometric pattern will flow and shift in real time. Similar to a game, this installation has additional levels that users can achieve by completing certain tasks.  For example, if a user waves their hand over a certain portion of the screen, a different background color may appear.  If the user places both of their hands near the new color and moves them in opposite directions, a space will be opened in the pattern and a new pattern will emerge.  This new level will have a different type of interaction and a different task that must be completed to move on to the next level.  After 5 levels, the installation will return back to the beginning.  As a result of this cyclical nature, users will be able to spend as little or as much time interacting with the installation as they would like since there is no true end or beginning. On the other hand, users may not even wish to move on to another level since they can interact and shift with any one level for as long as they would like.  

In order to increase variation for users who cycle through the installation many times, easter eggs situated at several edge cases within each level.  For example, if a user places one hand on one side of the installation and the other hand at the other side a new color or feature may be displayed.  Users who spend more time will discover more easter eggs, but users who spend less time will still be able to interact with and enjoy the installation without feeling confused about how to operate the installation.  In order to aid with any confusion, there will be visual hints and motions to encourage user interaction. These hints will fade in after a certain amount of inactivity from the user, but will not interfere with user play if the user decides to explore one level instead of advancing. 

As a whole, this installation intends to provide users with a carefree way to move their bodies, tap into their inner curiousity and problem solving skills, and enjoy a different mode of gameplay than they are probably used to. 

\section{Technical Background}
At the highest level, this installation focuses on human movement as the primary way of interacting with a computer.  This project will use handtrack.js, an open source hand tracking software by Victor Dibia \cite{}, to interpret user movement as input for the computer.  This software will use the video feed from a webcam to create a bounding box around each instance of a human hand or face.  It also classifies each hand as ``open'', ``closed'', ``pinch'', or ``point''.  Since handtrack.js is a JavaScript based package made for web applications, it makes sense to create this installation using HTML5, CSS3, and a webcam - elements that are common with most computers.   As a result, this installation may be repurposed as a web application for the general public after its run as an installation at Occidental College. 

This project will also make use of the MVC architecture often used in games.  MVC stands for Model, View, Controller and details the way these three components interface with each other. In the MVC architecture, the user interfaces with the controller which sends information to the model.  The model then changes according to the controller and updates the view which the user observes.  Based on this update, the user will decide what action to take through the controller to continue the cycle. 

In this project, the model will be written in javascript and will interface with handtrack.js (the controller) and the view (the HTML output).  The view will be generated using the built in javascript canvas properties to create geometric patterns that shift and change according to user movements. 
\section{Prior Work}

\citetitle{kwon_real-time_nodate} by \citeauthor{kwon_real-time_nodate} highlights many interactive generative art exhibits from the early 2000s. In 2003, Scott Snibbe created a visualization that recorded users' shadows and played them back allowing the user to add new shadows to the loop - similar to a guitar feedback loop.  Then, in 2015, Philip Worthington created the installation ``Shadow Monsters`` which used machine learning to recognize specific shapes and features in a user's shadow and modify it \cite{houston_public_media_mfah_2015}.  For example, shadows that look like circles will be made into eyes, and shadows that look like intersecting lines will be made into mouths.  This transformation happens in real time and artificial extremeties are added in real time to the shadow. These two installations forcus on modifying shadows from the user. However, ``Future You`` (2019) from Universal Everything, a technological art company, focuses on using the user as a puppeteer of sorts to animate a unique CGI character \cite{noauthor_future_2019}. This CGI character is a humanoid, futuristic being that is unique for each user based upon predetermined variables. Additionally, this character undergoes an evolution every 5 seconds becoming more complex the longer a user interacts with it.  In this way, the program is generating and modifying the art based upon the user's actions according to various variables (time and appearance).  This paper describes an art installation that uses various aspects from all of this previous work. 


\section{Methods}

\section{Evaluation Metrics}

\section{Ethical Considerations}

\subsection{Ethical Design}\label{sec:design}

In the textbook ``Introduction to Art: Design, Context, and Meaning,'' \cite{blood_introduction_nodate}the authors caution against different types of unethical practices when creating an art piece.  Chapter 11, ``Art and Ethics'' warns against `appropriation' or the act of incorporating another artist's work into their own without any change or edits and without acknowledgement or credit. Similar to plagarism, this type of artistic appropriation not only steals intellectual property from the original artist, but also damages the credibility of the emerging artist.  While artists often borrow ideas, aesthetics, or even entire pieces from other artists, ``Introduction to Art...'' makes the distinction that these artists are intentionally altering the original idea in order to comment on it's original meaning or to recontextualize it in a new setting. In this way, new artists are still bringing their own intentions and ideas to the original work.  

``Computational Queries'' draws a lot of inspiration from Akash Nihilani, an artist known for his 3D geometric illusions. Specifically, his interactive geometric series titled ``Projections'' from 2015.  These interactive projections incorporate different geometric patterns that flow and ebb as users run their hands along the wall that the projections are screened on. As these geometric patterns move, bright colors are revealed in the space between each shape.  In a very similar way, ``Computational Queries'' will ask users to wave their hands in front of geometric patterns in order to reveal another `level' of the game.  While ``Computational Queries'' will have a different color scheme and type of user interaction than ``Projections,'' the two installations are still very similar.  As such, the final installation will offer a special thanks or acknowledgement for Akash Nihilani as an inspiration for this work. 

\subsection{Ethical Interaction}\label{sec:interaction}

As mentioned, this installation focuses on human movement as input.  Unfortunately, not all users will be able to interact with the installation.  Hand amputees will not be able to interact since the hand tracking software will not be able to accurately capture their arm movements. Furthermore, users with motor inhibitions may not be able to accurately complete the motions needed to advance to the next level.  Providing additional ways to interact with the piece becomes integral when dealing with differently abled people. Providing a joystick controller, handheld mouse, or eye tracking software as inputs to determine the position of the movement allows differently abled people alternatives ways to interact that don't involve their hands. 

In addition, this installation relies heavily on visual feedback for the user.  Users are visually instructed how to interact with the exhibit and then, when they are interacting, the installation responds to their movements visually.  Furthernore, people who interact with the exhibit will be visually prompted hints on screen as well as given visual feedback as a metric for success through the levels. As such, users with visual impairments will not experience any difference as they physically interact with the installation. By including a compelling soundscape that changes as a user interacts, the installation can mimic the visual outputs aurally. For example, as the user interacts with the pattern by moving their hands, the music could change or add a sound.  In this way, blind and low vision users can still interact with the exhibit.
